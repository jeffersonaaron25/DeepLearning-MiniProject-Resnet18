# DeepLearning-MiniProject-Resnet18
This repository contains the code for a deep learning mini project based on the ResNet18 architecture. The project includes training a modified ResNet18 model on CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluating its performance on a test set. This project was done by Jacob Fishman and Jefferson Aaron from NYU Tandon School of Engineering.
